<h1>ABOUT US</h1>
<h5>“My story is a personal one“</h5>
<p>It all started in 2012 after I became a mom and loved the concept of entrepreneurship. My love for accessories was my incentive to establish Store of fashion and started selling my products on Instagram and attending some events within the Kingdom of Bahrain. After a while, I wanted to expand my business and introduced Women Apparel. I always wanted to make my clothing brand label something personal which represents me; therefore, I have decided to call my clothing label “Carmen Chad”. Many of you don’t know the story behind the name. Carmen Chad is simply the names of my two beautiful children. </p> 
<p>
Over the years, Store of fashion has grown across the world and my commitment to the environment became more vivid after I became Vegan in 2018. My mission is to provide customers with Vegan Clothing, like Vegan food, which is any garment made without animal products. Some things may seem obvious (like leather and suede), but Vegan materials also exclude anything obtained through animal exploitation. Carmen Chad Vegan clothing avoids materials like silk, fur, feathers, angora, and down. Instead, we sell Vegan-friendly clothes out of plant-based and man-made fibers.
